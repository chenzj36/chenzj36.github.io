Welcome to my personal website! 

I am a Doctoral Student at North University of China, advised by Prof. Jianchao Zeng. My academic journey is currently focused on completing my doctoral dissertation in the field of low-level computer vision.

### Research Interests
My primary research revolves around computational imaging and enhancing visual data. Specifically, I am interested in:
* **Low-Light Image Denoising:** Developing robust algorithms and deep learning models to improve image quality in challenging lighting conditions.
* **Low-Level Computer Vision:** Exploring foundational vision tasks to reconstruct and restore degraded images.
* **Efficient Model Training:** Utilizing containerization tools like Docker for streamlined and reproducible deep learning model training pipelines.
